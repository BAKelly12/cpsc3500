README for p1
CPSC-3500 WQ2019
Sam Van Nes // Brigid Kelly

p1 is the implementation of a rudimentary UNIX-style command-line shell
to test and demonstrate functionality of kernel-level operations such as
fork(), pipe() and dup2().

To compile:  
    make p1

To run:  
    ./p1

To add to .tar archive:
    make tar

To submit:
     make submit


Strengths:
    -Handles all single-line commands and pipes
    -Is able to parse and tokenize all delimiters proerly
    -can fully execute command:
         cat moby.txt | tr A-Z a-z | tr -C a-z '\n' | sed  '/^$/d' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | sed 10q 

Weaknesses:
    -Does not print child pid and exit status


Issues:
    -Is not looped so must be re-executed in order to test more commands
    

Team Members: 

    Bri:  
     Code structuring and functionality for pipe functions, execvp
     Comments and overall structure, debugging
     Makefile, README, submission, github setup

    Sam:  
     Code structuring and functionality for parse function, finalizing 
            functionality of pipe and dup2 functions.
            (fork_pipes(), spawn_proc()
     Overall finalizattion of functionality and debugging.
