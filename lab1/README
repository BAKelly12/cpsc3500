README for p1
CPSC-3500 WQ2019
Sam Van Nes // Brigid Kelly

p1 is the implementation of a rudimentary UNIX-style command-line shell
to test and demonstrate functionality of kernel-level operations such as
fork(), pipe() and dup2().

To compile:  
    make p1

To run:  
    ./p1

Strengths:
    -Handles all single-line commands and single pipe commands
    -Is able to parse and tokenize all delimiters proerly

Weaknesses:
    -currently cannot parse multiple commands if | is not separated by
        spaces on each side.


Issues:
    -Is not looped so must be re-executed in order to test more commands
    


Team Members: 

    Bri:  
     Code structuring and functionality for pipe functions, execvp
     Makefile, README, submission, github setup

    Sam:  
     Code structuring and functionality for parse function, finalizing 
            functionality of pipe and dup2 functions.
     Overall finalizattion of functionality and debugging.
