Weaknesses:
            SRTF does not place first element from list into queue before entering main
                algorithm loop.  This is an unneeded check and could cause branch
                misses and cpu cycle loss, especially when iterating over large amounts of data.
               
                 It also has a-for loop to find next process to queue.  This could be significant
                as it will cause algorithm to approach order  O(n^2) as opposed to O(nlogn)
